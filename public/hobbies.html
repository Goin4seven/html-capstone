    <h1>In My Free Time I Like To...</h1>

        <li><h2>Learn New Skills</h2></li>
            <p>
            During my free time, I also enjoy learning new skills and talents. I am currently learning Spanish in preparation for my 
            first international travel. I am also taking a course to learn web development skills. I have used website builders like 
            WordPress and GoDaddy to build webpages in the past. I have found the ability to create webpages to be an amazing way to express
            myself and utilize my creativity and imagination. To see some of my previous projects, take a look at my <a href="./projects.html">catalogue page</a>!
            </p>
        <li><h2>Watch Movies</h2></li>
            <p>I am a lifelong fan of sci-fi films and TV shows. My favorite films include 
                The Thing, Predator (original), Back to the Future, and The Matrix. 
                For new releaes, I have recently enjoyed watching some of the remakes or continuation of classic movies like
                Dune, Bladerunner, The Thing, Star Trek.
            </p>
            <p>For TV shows, my favorites include Twin Peaks, The X-Files, and The Strain. On the opposite end of the 
                spectrum, I enjoy work place comedies like Brooklyn 99, Abbott Elementary, and Superstore </p>
        <li><h2>Play Video Games</h2></li>
            <p>
            My current favorite video game to play is Escape From Tarkov. This game provides an interesting take on surviving 
            in an active warzone. Every item you loot throughout the game is important. Each item you pick up can be used for something. 
            There are food and drink items that you will need to prevent you from starving or becoming dehydrated. There are 
            items that can be used for crafting and some items need to be found for quests. As you progress through the game you 
            encounter enemies of all kinds, including the environment.
